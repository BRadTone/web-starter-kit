## Quickstart

[Download](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/releases/latest) the kit or clone this repository and build on what is included in the `app` directory.

There are two HTML starting points, from which you can choose:

- `index.html` - the default starting point, containing Material Design layout.
- `basic.html` - no layout, but still includes our minimal mobile best-practices

Be sure to look over the [installation docs](docs/install.md) to verify your environment is prepared to run WSK.
Once you have verified that your system can run WSK, check out the [commands](docs/commands.md) available to get started.
